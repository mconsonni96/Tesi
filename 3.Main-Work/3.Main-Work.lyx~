Main Work

\begin_layout Standard
The main goal of this thesis work has been to push even more the Time-to-Digital
 Converter performances, obtaining a drag-and-drop, tunable IP-Core, compatible
 also with Xilinx Ultrascale (20 nm) and Ultrascale+ (16 nm) technology
 nodes.
 The migration to a new technology, characterized by an improvement in the
 scaling with respect to 7-Series, has allowed to push even more the frequency
 of the clock involved in the measurements, thus giving a system with a
 faster conversion time, a lower dead-time and, a better resolution.
 The scaling has a beneficial effect also on the ultra-bins, which are lighter
 than the 7-Series counterpart, thus leading also to a better single-shot
 precision in the time measurements.

Let's now briefly see the blocks composing the TDC core in its older version,
 to then describe in detail each one of them and highlight the improvements
 given by this thesis work.

\begin_layout Subsection
Main blocks of the TDC
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The old version Time-To-Digital Converter implemented at the Digital Electronics
 Laboratory (DigiLAB) at Politecnico di Milano, has been implemented on
 Xilinx 7-Series (28 nm) Artix-7 FPGA, and it is a Tapped Delay-Line based
 Time-To-Digital Converter.
 The processing chain starts with the Virtual Tapped Delay-Line (V-TDL),
 which provides a thermometric code in output, representing the Fine part
 of the timestamp; then, a module called Iper Decoder converts the thermometric
 code in a binary one, giving the final Fine measure; after that, a Coarse
 Extension Core (CEC) module attaches the Fine part to the Coarse one (calculate
d by a Coarse Counter internal to the CEC or external to it), and also performs
 a Cross-Domain Clock (CDC) change, i.e.
 the system goes from a faster clock to a slower one, in order to have a
 processing on the following blocks that respects all the timing constraints
 of system; the next block is called Magic Calibrator, and it performs a
 bin-by-bin calibration in order to correct the already-mentioned process,
 voltage and temperature (PVT) variations of the TDL's taps; in the end,
 an Overflow Counter module solves the overflow problem given by the Coarse
 Counter, thanks to the possibility of counting overflows, thus extending
 even more the FSR.

All the blocks just mentioned are connected inside a hierarchical IP-Core,
 which represents a single channel of the TDC.
 The concept of channel is the following one: a single channel has the task
 of receiving one single physical event (i.e.
 START signal) and measuring its timestamp when the STOP signal (i.e.
 the rising-edge of the following clock cycle) occurs.
 Since we are usually interested in the relative time-distance between physical
 events, the TDC will be characterized by more than one channel, where each
 one of them will measure the corresponding timestamp with respect to a
 common absolute time reference (typically the power-on instant of the device);
 then, a final module called Histogrammer, external to the main TDC core
 and therefore not described in detail in this thesis, will perform a repeated
 set of measurements of the time difference between two of those channels,
 and it will thus provide a Gaussian distribution characterized by a mean
 value and a certain standard deviation.
 As we said in the FoM chapter, this standard deviation will be the index
 of the single-shot precision of the TDC.
