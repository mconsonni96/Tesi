Techniques (?)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the Time-to-Digital Converter employed in our laboratory consists
 of a Tapped Delay-Line architecture, let's describe the techniques used
 to implement it on the FPGA fabric.
 These techniques have the scope to improve as much as possible the Figures
 Of Merit (FOMs) already mentioned, and break the trade-off from which the
 TDL-TDC suffers from.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Sub-Interpolation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Sub-Interpolation is a technique used to reduce the quantization error
 of the TDC, thus improving its resolution.
 It exploits redundancy in the measurements in order to do that 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Sub"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The TDL-TDC implemented in our laboratory exploits spatial redundancy,
 i.e.
 the Super Wave Union (SuperWU) sub-interpolation algorithm, characterized
 by the use of more physical TDLs, placed in parallel.
 If we have 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 TDLs in parallel, each one with a real number 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{R}$
\end_inset

 of taps, we obtain the so-called Virtual Tapped Delay-Line (V-TDL), composed
 by 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{V}=N_{R}\cdot N$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

virtual taps
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with a 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 time faster propagation delay.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In practice, let's consider n 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 [1;N] replicas of the measure of the same time interval, performed by means
 of a TDL with 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{R}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 [1;
\begin_inset Formula $N_{R}$
\end_inset

] real bins characterized by the propagation delays 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{R}$
\end_inset

[n
\begin_inset Formula $_{R}$
\end_inset

] and FSR 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{FSR}$
\end_inset

.
 In this situation, the sub–interpolation process leads to obtain a Virtual
 Tapped Delay–Line (V–TDL) composed of n
\begin_inset Formula $_{V}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 [1;N
\begin_inset Formula $_{V}$
\end_inset

 ] “virtual bins” with t
\begin_inset Formula $_{V}$
\end_inset

[n
\begin_inset Formula $_{V}$
\end_inset

] propagation delays, where:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
t_{V}[n_{V}]=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^{n=N}t_{R}[n_{R}[n]]\\
n_{V}=\sum_{n=1}^{n=N}n_{R}[n]
\end{cases}\label{eq:subint-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, we can see that the sub–interpolation technique operates as a
 “bin–by–bin” averaging that reduces the delay of the real bins, obtaining
 virtual bins whose width is in average 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 time smaller than the one of the “real bins”.
 Thanks to this process, the resolution (LSB) is improved, as we can see
 by using Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:subint-1"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 in the V-TDL case, obtaining:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
LSB=\frac{T_{CLK}}{N_{V}}\label{eq:virtual-resolution}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{V}=N_{R}\cdot N$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, the LSB is 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 time smaller than the single TDL case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another important reason for using sub-interpolation is due to the phenomenon
 of the ultra-bin.
 As we said earlier, the buffers in the cascade are not characterized by
 equal propagation delays, and there is the possibility that one of them
 is very slow maybe due to the crossing of two different clock regions.
 This particular bin is called ultra-bin and it worsens the single-shot
 precision of the measurements, indeed: if we have the occurrence of the
 START signal, the probability that it falls on the slow ultra-bin rather
 than on the other ones is very high, thus giving an unreliable measure
 with respect to the case of comparable bin-widths.
 This is where the sub-interpolation technique becomes useful; as we can
 see from Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:subint-1"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the ultra-bin is splitted in faster virtual bins, and the measure uncertainty
 is improved a lot.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's see the Super Wave Union algorithm in detail.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 TDLs are arranged in parallel, and the START signal is increasingly delayed
 on each one of them in order to have minimum probability that it falls
 on real ultra-bins.
 This parallel architecture is very suitable for FPGA's spatial-computing
 structures and, moreover, the delay introduced on the START signal comes
 for free, because the routing process creates different paths that the
 signal has to cross moving towards each TDL.
 We can see a Super Wave Union implementation of order

\begin_layout Subsection
Nutt-Interpolation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we mentioned before, some TDC architectures typically suffer from a trade-off
 between resolution (LSB) and Full-Scale Range (FSR).
 In order to resolve this issue, a technique called Nutt-Interpolation is
 exploited 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Nutt1968DigitalTI"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This technique composes the time measurement by a Coarse part and a Fine
 one, the former being characterized by high FSR and low resolution, and
 the latter being at low FSR and high resolution.
 Our time measurement will be the difference of these two parts:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
T_{MEAS}=T_{COARSE}-T_{FINE}\label{eq:nutt-composition}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the Tapped Delay-Line context described up to now, 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{FINE}$
\end_inset

 is just the same as before, i.e.
 the time distance from the START event to the following clock edge (STOP
 signal), and it is therefore managed by the TDL itself; 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{COARSE}$
\end_inset

 is instead the number (
\begin_inset Formula $N_{COARSE}$
\end_inset

) of clock-cycles from the power on of the instrument to the same STOP edge
 just mentioned, and is managed by a module called Coarse Counter.
 Therefore, we have:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
T_{COARSE}=N_{COARSE}\cdot T_{CLK}\label{eq:coarse_part}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And, combining Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:nutt-composition"
plural "false"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 and Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:coarse_part"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, we have as measure of our timestamp:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
T_{MEAS}=N_{COARSE}\cdot T_{CLK}-T_{FINE}\label{eq:nutt_timestamp}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Considering a Coarse Counter with a BIT_COARSE bit-length, the FSR of the
 TDC is no more given by 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{CLK}$
\end_inset

, but it is instead equal to:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
FSR=(2^{BIT\_COARSE}-1)\cdot T_{CLK}\label{eq:nutt_FSR}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The LSB is instead still given by the TDL itself and by the Sub-Interpolation,
 thus leaving it untouched with respect to the new FSR.
 Therefore, Nutt-Interpolation is able to break the trade-off.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Calibration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since each buffer is affected by process, voltage and temperature (PVT)
 variations, a periodic bin-by-bin calibration process is required, otherwise
 the system would suffer from a very high non-linearity and the measures
 would be highly unreliable.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "8885152"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This process consists of the creation of a Calibration Table (CT) listing
 all the propagation delays of each one of the 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 bins (or virtual bins, if sub-interpolation is performed) composing the
 TDL, thus allowing to always know the exact propagation delay of each bin
 and obtain a reliable measurement.
 It is also necessary that the calibration process has a periodic refresh
 during the entire use of the TDC, in order to update the correct propagation
 delays of each bin.
 This is mandatory, since the working conditions change a lot during the
 use of the device, and therefore, the PVT variations would corrupt again
 the linearity and the measurements.
 Once the CT is built, the Characteristic Curve (CC) of the device can be
 derived.
 The CC is nothing but the integration of the CT, thus representing, for
 each one of the 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 bins, the total propagation delay of the asynchronous input signal from
 the first bin up to that specific considered bin.
 Therefore, once the TDL sends in output the thermometric code representing
 the bin that is reached by the input signal in its propagation process,
 it is possible to read from the CC the precise propagation delay up to
 that bin, and the exact Fine measure, in picoseconds, is obtained.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the bins are not ideal, they all have different propagation delays
 and, due to the crossing of different clock regions, some of them can be
 particularly slow.
 The latters are called ultra-bins, as said before.
 In Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 is reported a CT and the derived CC, in both the ideal and in the real
 cases.
