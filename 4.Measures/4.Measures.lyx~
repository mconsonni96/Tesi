\begin_layout Standard
The experimental results obtained by this new implementation will now be
 shown.
 We have tested all the performances of the Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC)
 on the KCU105 Evaluation Board by Xilinx, that is a development kit hosting
 a Kintex-UltraScale™ Field Programmable Gate Array (xcku040-ffva1156-2-e).

\begin_layout Standard
The setup that has been used for the measurements exploits the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Start-Stop Generator
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, a module which is in charge of producing the Asynchronous Input signals.
 It is a module developed by my Tutor, consisting of an internal Ring Oscillator
 that produces a periodic square wave; the asynchronous signal is directly
 sent at the START output, while at the STOP output is sent its delayed
 version, with a delay 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{Delay}$
\end_inset

.
 This module is the one in charge of sending the random input signals, at
 the power-on of the system, needed to build the Calibration Table (CT)
 of the TDC; however, once the Calibration is completed, these signals can
 also be used as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

real
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 input signals to be measured.
 In this work, a 3-channel TDC has been used, and the Start-Stop Generator
 feeds the channels as shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Start-Stop-Generator-connection"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 As we can see, the STOP signal feeds both Channel 1 and Channel 2 and,
 thanks to the routing on the FPGA, a delay 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{Skew}$
\end_inset

 is present at the input of these channels.
 The time distance between two rising-edges of the asynchronous input signals
 on Channel 1 and Channel 2 is what has been measured; therefore, the time
 information on 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{Skew}$
\end_inset

 has been obtained.
 (Obviously, the same thing can be done either between Channel 0 and Channel
 1, or between Channel 0 and Channel 2).

\begin_layout Itemize
Verification of the benefits of Sub-Interpolation, in the case where the
 Virtual Tapped Delay-Line (V-TDL) is composed by CARRY-chains only: the
 Resolution (LSB), the single-shot precision (
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{r.m.s.})$
\end_inset

 and the hardware utilization have been measured, in the two cases where
 the V-TDL is composed only by a single TDL and by 4 TDLs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Study of the sub-interpolating capability with the introduction of the DSP-chain
s in the V-TDL.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Inspection of the hardware utilization vs.
 the single-shot precision, in the two cases in which the 4 TDLs (maximum
 level of beneficial Sub-Interpolation) are composed just by CARRY-chains,
 or by a mix of DSP-chains and CARRY-chains.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's describe each experiment, one by one, and show the achieved experimental
 results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Verification of the Super Wave Union Sub-Interpolation on the carry-based
 V-TDL
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This first experiment consisted of comparing two different implementations
 of the Virtual Tapped Delay-Line, the first one without Sub-Interpolation
 (which means that one single physical TDL is used to carry out the fine
 measurement) and the second one with Sub-Interpolation, using 4 TDLs in
 parallel.
 Both these two implementations have been made by using just CARRY-chains,
 and no DSP-chains.
 In particular, a comparison between the Calibration Tables (CT) in the
 two cases has been made, as shown in Figure

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we can see, the latter case produces a four-times wider Calibration Table
 with respect to the former case, and it is due to the fact that SuperWU
 algorithm produces 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{V}$
\end_inset

 virtual taps equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $N\cdot N_{R}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{R}$
\end_inset

 is the number of taps of the single, real, TDL (512 in our case), and 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is the number of TDLs used in parallel (4 in our case).
 Therefore, 2048 virtual taps have been obtained in the case with Sub-Interpolat
ion.
 However, the most relevant information provided by the Calibration Tables
 is the one involving the propagation delays of the taps composing the TDL.
 In fact, the virtual taps of the sub-interpolated TDL are overall faster
 than their real counterpart and, most of all, the 19-ps ultra-bin is lowered
 a lot during this process.
 This leads to a better single-shot precision in the time measurement between
 Channel 1 and Channel 2.
 The information about the time measurement is contained in a histogram
 produced by the BeltBus_TDCHistogrammer module mentioned before, which
 is in charge of performing a set of repeated measurements of the time intervals
 elapsing between the events on the two channels; the x-axis represents
 the time difference, in picoseconds (ps), while the y-axis represents the
 number of occurrences of that specific time measurement.
 Therefore, it's clear that, if a Gaussian curve is fitted on this histogram,
 we will consider as an highly-precise time measurement the one where this
 Gaussian curve is as narrow as possible, meaning that the spread (uncertainty)
 of the calculated time interval is very low.
 Thus, the Figure-of-Merit of the single-shot precision of the TDC will
 be the standard deviation (
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{r.m.s.}$
\end_inset

) of the fitted Gaussian curve on the histogram.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 shows the histograms representing the final time measurement between Channel
 1 and 2, in the case without Sub-Interpolation (on the left) and with Sub-Inter
polation, using 4 TDLs in parallel (on the right).
 As expected by the bin-splitting phenomenon given by the SuperWU algorithm,
 the latter case has a lower standard deviation and, therefore, a better
 single-shot precision.

Also the resolution of the TDL is improved by a factor 
\begin_inset Formula $N=4$
\end_inset

 thanks to the Sub-Interpolation, in fact:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
LSB=\frac{T_{CLK}}{N_{V}}=\frac{T_{CLK}}{N\cdot N_{R}}\label{eq:tdl_lsb}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Obviously, the benefits in terms of resolution and single-shot precision
 are paid with a greater utilization of hardware resources, resulting in
 a lower number of maximum implementable channels on the FPGA fabric.

Preliminary studies about the introduction of the DSP-chains in the Super
 Wave Union Sub-Interpolation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since, as we saw earlier, the DSP48E2 block is used in Dual 24-bit mode
 (meaning that its internal Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) works as two, 24-bit,
 sub-ALUs in parallel), from now on we will refer to it by calling 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

FULL-DSP
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 a DSP exploiting both its halves to generate both thermometric codes, while
 we will call 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

HALF-DSP
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 a DSP that produces just one thermometric code using just one of its halves.
 Obviously, from the hardware point of view, nothing changes, since in both
 cases they are just the same dedicated DSP blocks placed by Xilinx on the
 FPGA fabric; the difference is just related to collection of the generated
 thermometric codes: a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

FULL-DSP
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 generates two thermometric codes at the output, both contributing to the
 Sub-Interpolation process in the Decoder module; an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

HALF-DSP
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 generates instead just one thermometric code, acting therefore as a case
 without any Sub-Interpolation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This second experiment consisted in acquiring the Calibration Tables of
 the V-TDL and studying how much the Sub-Interpolation algorithm can be
 beneficial with the introduction of DSP-chains alongside the CARRY-chains.
 Being this just a preliminary study about the SuperWU effectiveness, a
 Sub-Interpolation of order 
\begin_inset Formula $N=2$
\end_inset

 has been carried out.

, in order to have an effective Sub-Interpolation (which means that is capable
 of splitting the ultra-bins and giving a V-TDL characterized by propagation
 delays of the virtual bins as homogeneous as possible), we would like to
 have the 2 Tapped Delay-Lines (TDLs) as different as possible.
 The degree of dissimilarity between the two TDLs has been calculated by
 performing the cross-correlation function between the Calibration Tables
 of each one of the two TDLs.
 In particular, the normalized cross-correlation has been calculated.
 The cross-correlation is a measure of similarity between two signals.
 By considering as 
\begin_inset Formula $CT_{1}$
\end_inset

 the Calibration Table (composed by 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{CT1}$
\end_inset

 bins) acquired from the first TDL, and 
\begin_inset Formula $CT_{2}$
\end_inset

 (composed by 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{CT2}$
\end_inset

 bins) the one acquired from the second TDL, we call 
\begin_inset Formula $CT_{1}^{*}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $CT_{2}^{*}$
\end_inset

 their mean-free version, i.e:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
CT_{1}^{*}[n]=CT_{1}[n]-mean(CT_{1})\ ,\ n=1,2,....,N_{CT1}\label{eq:mean_free1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
CT_{2}^{*}[n]=CT_{2}[n]-mean(CT_{2})\ ,\ n=1,2,....,N_{CT2}\label{eq:mean_free2}

 are used in the cross-correlation function in order to avoid the ramp-like
 behavior of the final result.
 The normalized cross-correlation function has been calculated as follows:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
R_{CT_{1}^{*}CT_{2}^{*}}[k]=\sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty}CT_{1}^{*}[m]\cdot CT_{2}^{*}[m+k]\label{eq:crosscorr}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is the lag between the two signals, representing the shift of the second
 CT with respect to the first one, in number of bins.
 This cross-correlation has then been normalized, in order to be in the
 [-1;1] range, by using this relation:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\rho_{CT_{1}^{*}CT_{2}^{*}}[k]=\frac{R_{CT_{1}^{*}CT_{2}^{*}}}{\sqrt{\sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty}(CT_{1}^{*}[m])^{2}\cdot\sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty}(CT_{2}^{*}[m])^{2}}}\label{eq:norm_crosscorr}
\end{equation}

The maximum value of 0.3 proves that the CARRY-chains are quite dissimilar,
 thus giving an effective Sub-Interpolation.
 In Figure

 we can see that the CT of the V-TDL in this case is quite flat, meaning
 that the propagation delays along the bins are homogeneous, and the SuperWU
 algorithm has been effective.

The maximum value is 0.2, which is comparable with the previous case.
 Therefore, the Sub-Interpolation is very effective also here but, since
 the ultra-bins of the HALF-DSP chain are very huge, in the order of 250
 ps, the resulting Calibration Table will not be as flat as the previous
 case, as we can see in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Calibration-Table-of-1"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Anyway, the great effectiveness of the Sub-Interpolation can be seen by
 the fact that the ultra-bin is now just 18 ps rather than the original
 250 ps.

We can see that the maximum value is 1, and there are also other peaks being
 quite high.
 This means that two HALF-DSP-chains are often very similar, and the SuperWU
 algorithm is not so effective in this case.
 This is also proved by the resulting CT of the V-TDL, shown in Figure

Anyway, as said before, achieving an ultra-bin which is 50 ps faster, using
 the exact same hardware resources of the HALF-DSP-chain, leads to the obvious
 choice of always using the FULL-DSP chain, since this gain on the ultra-bin
 will be significant for the single-shot precision, when combined with other
 CARRY-chains.
